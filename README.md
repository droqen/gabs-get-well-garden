# gabs-get-well-garden

a game for gab, made by the paradise community

## how to play

watch stuff happen, interact minimally by clicking on things. arrow keys / middle click to pan around the world

## elevator pitch

this is a game with a whole bunch of different ecosystems shoved together in a messy garden world.
many different devs can all make their own ecosystems within the game that interact with the other devs' ecosystems in fun unplanned ways.

the game is tile-based to keep things simple, and the different tiles (called "drifters") interact indirectly by reading the "vibe" of their surroundings

simple example: bob creates River, Fish, and Crocodile drifters. these are high in the Water, Sand, and Wind vibes. alice creates bird drifters that prefer to move towards high-Wind areas. the observed emergent behavior is that birds like to fly along rivers! fun. even more fun: the vibe types are deliberately vague, so that different people interpreting them differently will cause weird and cool interactions to happen
